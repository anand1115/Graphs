<h2>Defination<h2>
-->Graph is a non-linear data structure which consists of nodes/vertices/points and edges/lines/arcs(used to connect the pair of nodes).
-->Graph is a finite set of nodes and edges which is used to connect the pair of nodes.
-->Graph is pictorial representation of set of objects,where some pair of objects connected together by links.The interconnected objects are termed as nodes and links present between pair of objects termed as edges.
-->Graph is simply cyclic tree.

Example:-
Consider a graph pf vertices V(A,B,C,D,E) and edges E((A,B), (B,C), (C,E), (E,D), (D,B), (D,A)) is represented as follows

Applications:-
-->Graphs are used for developing recommandation system for social media applications and ecommerce applications
-->graphs are used to represent the flow of computation in computer science.
-->Google maps uses graphs for building transportation systems, where intersection of two(or more) roads are considered to be a vertex and the road connecting two vertices is considered to be an edge, thus their navigation system is based on the algorithm to calculate the shortest path between two vertices.
